# VS Quest

Die Mod aims to add Quests to Vintage Story.<br>
It should also enable you to easily add your own quests to the game as well as your own questgivers.<br>
<br>
If you want to use this as a base for creating your own quests, please have a look at this **[example](example)**. The most important aspects to take care of are the **[quests.json](example/assets/vsquestexample/config/quests.json)** as well as the **[questgiver behavior](example/assets/vsquestexample/entities/questgiver.json#L229-L235)**
